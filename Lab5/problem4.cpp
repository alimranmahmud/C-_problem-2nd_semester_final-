// 4. Create a class called card that maintains a library card catalog entry. In the card, it will store a
// bookâ€™s title, author and number of copies on hand. Store the title, author as string and the
// number of books on hand as an integer value. Use two public functions store () to store the title,
// author and number of books on hand. And another public function display () will display the
// information.
